# C3-Robot-Arm-Control
This project is aimed to solve the forward and inverse kinematics of Epson C3 Robot arm, and to control the robot arm by following a simple path like a circle and a line. This repository also contains implementation of several control methods; PD controller, PD with gravity compensation, and resolved motion rate control.
