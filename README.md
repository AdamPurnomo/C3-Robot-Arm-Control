# C3-Robot-Arm-Control
## Overview
This project is aimed to solve the forward and inverse kinematics of Epson C3 robot arm, and to control the robot arm by following a simple path like a circle and a line. This repository also contains implementation of several control methods; PD controller, PD with gravity compensation, and resolved motion rate control. 

## DH-Parameters
DH-parameters are used to solve both forward and inverse kinematic. The DH-Parameters of Epson C3 robot arm is provided in the figure as follows.
